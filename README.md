RM4Linux is a port of the popular Roblox Account Manager to Linux.

> [!WARNING]
> **Voltux ONLY!!**
> This tool is designed specifically for **[Voltux](https://discord.gg/voltux)**. There are currently no plans to add support for Sober anytime soon.

Please report any issues you encounter on this repo!

> **⚠️ Disclaimer:** This tool interacts with Roblox authentication cookies and game-launching internals. Use at your own risk. The multi-instance feature bypasses Roblox's singleton mutex, which may conflict with Hyperion anti-cheat and could carry ban risk. This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Roblox Corporation.

## Features

- **Multi-Account Management** - Add, remove, and organize Roblox accounts with cookie-based auth
- **Encrypted Storage** - AES-256-GCM, unlocked automatically via Windows Credential Manager. An optional master password (Argon2id) is available for anyone who wants one
- **Multi-Instance** - Launch multiple Roblox clients simultaneously
- **Bulk Launch** - Launch selected accounts into the same server sequentially
- **Privacy Mode** - Clears tracking cookies before each launch
- **Auto Window Tiling** - Arranges Roblox windows in a grid after launch
- **Live Presence** - Real-time Online / In Game / In Studio / Offline indicators

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (stable, 1.75+)
- Windows 10/11 (required for Win32 APIs)

### Build

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://gitlab.com/centerepic/robloxmanager.git
cd ram2

# Build in release mode
cargo build --release

# Run
cargo run --release
```

The compiled binary will be at `target/release/ram_ui.exe`.

### Development

```bash
# Check for errors without building
cargo check

# Run with debug logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run
```

## Usage

1. **First launch** - Nothing to set up. Encryption configures itself on this PC
2. **Add accounts** - Click "+ Add Account" and paste your `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie
3. **Launch** - Select an account, enter a Place ID, and click Launch
4. **Bulk launch** - Ctrl+click or Shift+click to select multiple accounts, then use the group panel
5. **Settings** - Configure multi-instance, privacy mode, auto-arrange, and more

## Background

RM is the spiritual successor to [ByeBanAsync](https://github.com/centerepic/ByeBanAsync), since just clearing RobloxCookies.dat isn't effective anymore. If you completely avoid the browser, this heavily limits Roblox's ability to link your accounts.

Later updates may be made to reinforce anti-association if needed.
